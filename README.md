# Naive Bayes Model for Diabetes Prediction

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to train a Naive Bayes classifier for predicting whether a person has diabetes based on health metrics.

## Features
- Data loading with Pandas
- Preprocessing
- Model training with Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Accuracy evaluation
- Model saving with Joblib

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib

## How to Run
1. Make sure `diabetes.csv` is in the same directory.
2. Run the notebook.
3. The trained model will be saved as `naive_bayes_model.pkl`.
